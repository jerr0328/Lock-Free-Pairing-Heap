\begin{frame}{What is Spam?}
  \begin{block}{Definition}
    Spam is unwanted and unsolicited bulk e-mail.
  \end{block}
  % Spam is un
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The MAAWG (Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group) estimates that close to $90\%$ of all e-mail
    is spam.\footnote{Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group, 2011 E-mail Metrics Report (November 2011): \href{http://bit.ly/wUYvwO}{http://bit.ly/wUYvwO}}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why does spam exist?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Asymmetric fixed costs. A spammer only needs to maintain a few servers in order
      to pump out millions of e-mails.
    \item Marginal costs are also low, so a spammer only needs a few conversions to
      recoup the cost of sending, say, $100\, 000$ e-mails.
    \item Spam is a popular strategy for monetizing illegal activity. E.g.:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Turn your botnet into profit by spewing spam.
        \item Sell databases of compromised websites.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethical Evaluations: The Kantian View}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The costs (time, e-mail infrastructure upgrades) of spam are borne almost entirely by
      recipients.
    \item Spammers treat their recipients as a means to sell products instead of an end.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item To make spam ethical, make sure your recipients are actually interested in your products.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethical Evaluations: Act Utilitarian View}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cost-benefit analysis:
      \item Say you send $100$ million e-mails selling a $30$ dollar item.
      \item Suppose $80$ percent of purchasers receive $\$50$ benefits, and $20$ percent have
        buyer's remorse.
      \item Say unwanted spam causes $\$0.05$ of damages (wasted time) to recipients.
      \item You make a $5$ dollar profit on each sale.
      \item What proportion $x \in (0,1)$ of e-mail recipients should purchase your item to make
        this bulk mailing ethical?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethical Evaluations: Act Utilitarian View}
  Find $x$ such that:
  \begin{block}{Act Utilitarian Calculation}
    \begin{align*}
      80\%(10^8)(x)(50) &+ (10^8)(x)(5) > \\
      20\%(10^8)(x)(30) &+ (10^8)(1-x)(0.05)
    \end{align*}
  \end{block}
  \textbf{Solution}: $x > 0.13\%$ ($1$ out of about $800$ purchase.)

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Actual spam conversion rates are about 1 sale per 10 million spams.\footnote{Spamalytics: An Empirical Analysis of Spam Marketing Conversion, \textit{Communications of the ACM}, vol 52, no. 9 (Sept. 2009)}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethical Evaluations: Rule Utilitarian View}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Similar to our act utilitarian calculation, but we should also consider more costs:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item E-mail costs are driven up because of increased load.
        \item E-mail is less useful for everyone:  we have to maintain blacklists and develop spam
          filters.
      \end{itemize}
    \item We should also consider expected/average monetary values instead of values specific to our
      situation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethical Evaluations: Social Contract Theory}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Multiple arguments to be made here.
  \item If we consider freedom of expression in our social contract, is spam protected speech?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item In the US, spam is regulated speech governed under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2004.\footnote{15 USC Chapter 103: \href{http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C103.txt}{http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C103.txt}}
    \item Spam filters such as DNS-based Black Lists (DNSBBLs) and Bayesian spam classifiers are widespread enough to be considered a form of voluntary self-regulation.\footnote{Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, Lawrence Lessig (1999.)}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ethical Evaluations: Social Contract Theory}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Spammers violate fundamental aspects of human communication.
  \item Spammers disguise the source (\texttt{FROM:} SMTP field), the intent (misleading subjects), and the identity (odd domain names) of their messages.
  \item This shields spammers from some negative results of their actions.
  \end{itemize}
