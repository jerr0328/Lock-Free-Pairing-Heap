Currently, we have implemented Skiplists, pairing-heaps and lock-free pairing heaps.

(These files are a little disorganized right now, sorry!)

LFPairingHeap.java -> One start at a lock-free pairing heap
PairingHeap.java -> Another start at a lock-free pairing heap
PairingHeapNode.java -> A node in a pairing heap
Weighted.java -> A class that encapsulates an assignable weight (e.g., the distance of a node from the source in Dijkstra's algorithm.)
PairingHeap2.java -> A serial pairing heap coded in a functional way
PairingHeapMain.java -> Dummy main()
PairingHeapTest.java -> Unit tests for the pairing heap
Rnd.java -> Random number generator
Skiplist.java -> Implementation of a lock-free skiplist.
SkiplistTest.java -> Unit tests for the skiplist
